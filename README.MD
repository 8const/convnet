I try to train a simple convolutional network in pure numpy.
Feedforward is already done.

I want to remind myself to not focus on the derivation of the gradient formulas yet.
I should implement it first and only then prove all the math.
It's way more efficient in this way.
Because I'll be more familiar with the architecture when working on proofs.
Also I'll have a much better intuition.

CODE FIRST THEN DO MATH
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME
Most parts of this code aren't supposed to be read by other people or modified. It's quite terrible. I only want it to work.
