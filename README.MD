I try to code convolutional a network in pure numpy.

UPDATE:

simple_one works pretty well (88% accuracy) after only 10k trinin examples and with my noob hardcoded kernels.


Most parts of this code aren't supposed to be read by other people or modified. It's quite terrible. I only want it to work.
