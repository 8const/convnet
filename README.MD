I try to train a simple convolutional network in pure numpy.
Feedforward is already done.

I want to remind myself to not focus on the derivation of the gradient formulas yet.
I should implement it first and only then prove all the math.
It's way more efficient in this way.
Because I'll be more familiar with the architecture when working on proofs.
Also I'll have a much better intuition.

CODE FIRST THEN DO MATH
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME

NOTE: 
FIGURE OUT WTF IS FULL CONVOLUTION
seems to be what you're looking for.
